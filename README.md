### architecture:

- Component-based: Is an approach to software design where the system is built by mounting independent, reusable components that encapsulate specific functionality or visual elements.
- separation of concerns (SoC): is a design principle that dividing a software system into distinct sections, with each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality.

#### Folder architecture:

1 _src:_ This is the main folder where the source code resides.

- _app:_ Contains code related to the core functionality of application.

  - contexts: This folder contains React context providers and related logic for managing global state.
  - hooks: custom React hooks that provide reusable pieces of logic for a components.
  - router: related to routing in application.
  - utils: Contains utility functions and helper methods that are used across application.

- _views:_ Contains code related to the visual representation of application.
  - components: This folder contains reusable UI components that are used across multiple pages or sections.
  - pages: represent different pages or views. Each page component typically corresponds to a specific route.
  - styles: CSS-in-JS files that provide styling for components and pages.
